# PDALib
 PDALib aka Preprocessor Definitions Assembly Library is for making syscalls and escape sequences more intuitive and easier to memorize than numbers.  It is aim for NASM Linux x86_32 and x86_64. Run install_NASM.sh if you haven't install nasm yet. Run setup.sh to set up PDALib. It will create a folder called "PDALib" in usr/include/ and add files from PDALib folder to there. Do %include "usr/include/PDALib/all" to use them. It will automatically include x86_64 or x86_32 depending on file format you choose while assembling.
